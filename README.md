# Weather App

A simple Weather App Using `React + Hooks + Bootstrap`.

It calls the [server](https://weather-server-app.herokuapp.com/) side of this app which is built with `Node.js` and `Express.js` [github code](https://github.com/mayank-1/Weather-Server-App), which internally calls an API to fetch weather data from the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) wesbite. So this project is just an example of how to make a Web app using `React + Hooks, Nodejs, Expressjs, Bootstrap`.

If you want to try this project. Just clone this Repository and follow these steps to run the app:

- `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the project
- `npm start` to run the app on `localhost:3000`

### Don't Forget to give this Repo a `STAR` if you liked it. Motivates me a lot.
